This is an open source plant care system for anyone. It will utilize low-power internet connected devices like the ESP8266 to control plant care equipment. A Raspberry Pi or alternative acts as a server for the individual plant-modules to connect to for configuration and management.

## WIP
This is a work in progress. It is being developed for the DSM WebGeeks IOT Challenge.
