This is an open source plant care system for anyone. It utilizes low power, low cost WiFi enabled ESP32 microcontrollers to collect data and control equipment. A Raspberry Pi or alternative acts as a server for the individual plant-modules to connect to for configuration and management.

## WIP

This project is a Work in Progress. Much will change during development, and there are no guarantees that things will run perfectly. Help and feedback are appreciated.
